Robotic mimicry of human motion is a well explored idea that presents many interesting applications like remote robotic assistance, but often employs the use of complex sensor suits as input in order to track the subject's pose and motion. In this project, we aim to reduce complexity by using computer vision via widely available webcams to robustly and accurately track poses instead. 

Baxter the Mimicker is based on Rethink Robotic's Baxter Platform, a widely used robotic research platform in academia. The robot features 2 arms, each with 7 degrees of freedom, which makes it well suited to emulating human movement.
