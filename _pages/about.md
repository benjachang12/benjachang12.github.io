Hello! I'm Ben, a recent 2020 graduate from UC Berkeley with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. 


Robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the future of transportation/personal mobility excite me, and I love working on diverse, interdisciplinary projects. My interests and experiences lie broadly at the intersection of robotics, controls, machine learning, mathematical modeling and simulation. Additionally, I have demonstrated experience in engineering analysis, mechanical design, manufacturing, and product design. 


Outside of work, I love hacking with my 3D printer, cooking, and hiking. I'm also an avid bike fanatic and love repairing/working on bikes and cycling around the Bay.
