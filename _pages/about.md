Hello! I'm Ben, a recent 2020 graduate from UC Berkeley with an interest in robotics, autonomous vehicles, simulation, and controls. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (yes it's a mouthful to say). 

My other hobbies include 3D printing, woodworking, and trying out new recipes. I'm also an avid bike fanatic and love repairing/working on bikes and cycling around the Bay.
